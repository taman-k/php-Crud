# php-crud
CRUD is an acronym for Create, Read, Update, and Delete. As the name suggests, these operations manipulate data in a database that is important to any web application's basic functionality. We can create a PHP application coupled with a MySQL database to perform these operations. I will be presenting a complete CRUD system containing login and register feature. User should register himself first. And then he can add data after logging in......

1.Create Database. 2.Connection establish with database. 3.Create a listing file. 4.Insert the Data. 5.Edit the data. 6.Update the data. 7.Delete the data.
